**A school projekt for Storslett VGS**

This project simulates a simple banking system, well more like an ATM.
It has login and registration, the profiles gets saved in a txt file for later use so even if you close the program it can still remember you.
The essestials are all here. Withdrawel, depositing and showing the balance.
